# Omegaquad

A framework for making games using Macroquad.

After writing maybe 5 games and finding myself always going to the previous project to copy-paste code
I decided I was about done with that and I should make a template.

This code displays a logo screen! I've decided to rebrand my game making stuff to Falling Colors.
As discussed in the license, you can use the code but please don't steal the assets.
